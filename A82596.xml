            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VVE the Lords and Commons, in this preſent
Parliament aſſembled, doe in the preſence of
Almighty God, for the ſatisfaction of our
Conſciences, and diſcharge of that great truſt which lyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, make this proteſtation and Declaration to this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and Nation, and to the whole world, that no private
paſſion or reſpect, no evill intention to his Majeſties perſon,
no deſigne to the prejudice of his juſt honour and authority,
engaged us to raiſe Forces and take up armes againſt the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of this War, wherewith the Kingdome is now infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
            <p>And we have alwayes deſired from our hearts and ſoules,
manifeſted in our actions and proceedings, and in ſeverall
humble Petitions and Remonſtrances to his Majeſty, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
our loyalty and obedience to his Crown, readineſſe &amp;
reſolution to defend his perſon, and ſupport his eſtate with
our lives and fortunes to the uttermoſt of our power.</p>
            <p>That we have beene willing to paſſe by, not onely thoſe
Injuries, Ignominies, Slanders, and falſe Accuſations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we have beene privately oppreſſed and grieved, but
likewiſe many publike incroachments, and high uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to the prejudice of Religion and Liberty, divers bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
Trayterous and cruell practiſes and deſignes, for the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ruine and diſtruction of the Church and State, ſo as wee
might for the time to come have beene ſecured from that
wicked and Malignant party, thoſe pernicious and Trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
counſells, who have beene the authors and fomentors
<pb facs="tcp:171275:3"/>
of the former miſchiefes and preſent calamities which have,
and ſtill doe diſtemper this Church and State.</p>
            <p>That for the ſame purpoſe, and for the avoyding of blood
we directed the Earle of <hi>Eſsex</hi> Lord Generall by himſelfe, or
others in ſome ſafe and honourable way to cauſe to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
an humble Petition, wherein we doe deſire nothing
from his Majeſty but that he would returne in peace to his
Parliament, and by their faithfull counſell and advice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the diſtempers and confuſions abounding in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
as he is bound to do, we therin profeſſing in the ſight of
Almighty God, which is the ſtrongeſt obligation &amp; aſſurance
that any chriſtian, and the moſt ſolemne publike faith which
any ſuch State as a Parliament can givetx, hat we would receive
him with all honour, yeeld him all true obedience and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
and faithfully endeavour to defend his perſon and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
from all danger, and to the uttermoſt of our power to
eſtabliſh to him and to his people, all the bleſſings of a
glorious and happy Raigne, as it is more largely expreſt in
that Petition.</p>
            <p>For the delivery of which Petition, his Excellency hath
twice ſent unto the King, humbly deſiring a ſafe conduct
for thoſe who ſhould be imployed therein, but his Majeſty
refuſed to give any ſuch ſafe conduct, or to receive this hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and dutifull Petition, by any addreſſe from the Earle of
<hi>Eſsex,</hi> ſaying that if Juſtice had beene done, the Gentleman
which brought the ſecond Meſſage could not expect his
liberty.</p>
            <p>By all which and many other evidences and Inducements,
we are fully convinc't in our judgements and beleefe, that the
Kings counſells and reſolutions are ſo engaged to the Popiſh
party, for the ſuppreſſion and extirpation of the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
that all hopes of peace and protection are excluded,
and that it is fully intended to give ſatisfaction to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
by alteration of Religion, and to the Cavaliers and
<pb facs="tcp:171275:3"/>
other Souldiers, by expoſing the wealth of the good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
eſpecially of this City of <hi>London,</hi> to be ſackt, plunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and ſpoyled by them.</p>
            <p>That for the better effecting herof, great numbers of Papiſts
have in ſhow conformed themſelves to the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
by comming to the Church, receiving the Sacrament,
and taking the oathes of Alegiance and Supremacy, which
ſome of their owne Prieſts have encouraged them to doe, by
maintaining that they might doe all thoſe things and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
good Catholikes: Under which cover his Majeſty did
at firſt begin to ſtrengthen himſelfe, thoſe of that Religion
being weake, and unable to indure the envy and diſcontent
which the arming of the Papiſts would procure in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and therefore endeavoured to keepe off all Jealouſies
and ſuſpitions by many fearefull oathes and imprecations,
concerning his purpoſe of maintaining the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and the Lawes of the Kingdome; cauſing ſome profeſt
Papiſts to be diſcharged out of his Army, and none to be
received that would not indure the Teſt of comming to
Church, receiving the Sacrament, and taking the oathes of
Allegiance.</p>
            <p>That his Majeſty being now growne ſtronger, and able as
he conceives to make good his owne ends by Armes, his
confidence in the Papiſts, doth more clearely appeare: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
impriſoned for Prieſts and Ieſuits have bin releaſed
out of the Goale of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> porfeſt Papiſts have bin in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to riſe and take up Armes, Commiſſions under his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Authority have bin granted to many of them for pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of command in this war, with power to raiſe men and
great numbers have bin raiſed by them, and they daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,

<hi>Loſtock</hi> in the County of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and diverſe Forces are
raiſed and paid by the Earle of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and his Son the
Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> &amp; as we are informed by an expreſſe meſſenger,
ſent from thoſe parts, the ſaid Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> a notorious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt,
is made Generall of all <hi>South-Wales,</hi> and we are further
informed out of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> by diverſe perſons of great worth
and quality, that thoſe that raiſe Forces in theſe parts for his
Majeſty, doe arme and imploy Papiſts, and uſe their advice
in their conſultations, all which is contrary to the ſolemne
Oathes, Proteſtations and execrations, whereby his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty
bound himſelfe to maintaine the Proteſtant Religion,
and the lawes of the Land, by which he endeavoured to get a
confidence in the people of his good intentions, which
how well it is anſwered, wee leave to the world to iudge,</p>
            <p>That <hi>S. Iohn Hinderſon</hi> &amp; Col. <hi>Cockram,</hi> men of ill repor both
for Religion &amp; honeſty, ſent to <hi>Hamburg</hi> &amp; <hi>Denmark,</hi> as we are
credibly informed to raiſe Forces there, &amp; to bring them to
<hi>New-Caſtl.</hi> &amp; to ioyn with the Earl of <hi>New Caſtl.</hi> &amp; the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of Papiſts, which they intend to raiſ there, &amp; that divers
endeavours have bin uſed in other foraigne parts to bring in
ſtrange Forces into the Kingdome; that the King hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
about him diverſe Papiſts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſome of which are
indited of high Treaſon for their rebellion there, notoriou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly
known to have bin in actuall Rebellion, as namely the L.
<hi>Yaffe,</hi> S. <hi>Iohn Dungane,</hi> proclaimed a Rebell, Colo, <hi>Fitz VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams,</hi>
Doctor <hi>Meara</hi> indited for the Rebellion in Ireland,
and fled for the ſame, and yet appointed Phyſitian to Prince
<hi>Rupert</hi>; and that his Maieſty hath ſent for the Petition of
the Iriſh Rebels, which the Juſtices had ſtopt, with evident
expresſion of favour to them, whereby that Kingdome is
like to become an unfit habitation of any Proteſtants, and
<pb facs="tcp:171275:4"/>
a ſeminary of war and treaſon againſt this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>That diverſe Engliſh Traytors, actors in the former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes
againſt the Kingdome and Parliament, are the chiefe
Councellors and actors in this unnaturall warre againſt his
Subiects, as the Lord <hi>Digby, Oneale, Wilmot, Pollard, Aſhburn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
and others.</p>
            <p>That wee have bin likewiſe credibly informed, that diverſe
Jeſuits, and Prieſts in foraigne parts, make great collections
of money, for reliefe of the papiſts in Ireland, and the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
of his Maieſties deſignes here againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that by them, and ſome others, fled out of this
Kingdome for Treaſon: great meanes are made to take up
the differences betwixt ſome Princes of the Roman Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that ſo they might unite their ſtrength, for the extirpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the proteſtant Religion, wherein principally this
Kingdome, and the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> are concerned, as
making the greateſt body of the Reformed Religion in
Chriſtendome, and beſt able to defend themſelves, and
ſuccour other Churches.</p>
            <p>For all which reaſons we are reſolved to enter into a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
oath and Covenant with God, to give up our ſelves,
our Lives and Fortunes into his hands, and that we wil to the
uttermoſt of our power, and Judgement, maintaine his truth,
and conforme our ſelves to his will, That wee will defend

procure and eſtabliſh the ſafety of Religion, and fruition of
our Lawes and Liberties, in this and all other his Maieſties
Dominions, which we doe here againe profeſſe before the
ever-living God, to be the chiefe end of all our Counſells
